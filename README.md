Educating and mentoring HR professionals to embrace the practices of People Analytics is a challenge. [There are barriers](https://www.littalics.com/learning-culture-rituals-and-establishing-people-analytics/), and it takes time and effort to overcome them. However, one issue remained unsolved for years: The lack of open HR data to practice on. Although there are many inspiring case studies of People Analytics, obviously, organizations donâ€™t share their people data for the sake of learning. Simulation-based data may be an alternative, though usually it is oversimplified and lacks real or interesting patterns to explore.
